# This application can calculate the result of various simple arithmetic expressions where integers can participate and operations like
# ()
# +
# -
# *
# /
# Example expressions:
# 100 + 2 * 6
# 100 * ( 2 + 12 )
# -(-1*3)(3+(-2)
# -(-1*3)(2+(-2)) 
# Check the expression for the correctness
# Is the first version, it will be improved in  the future
